\begin{homeworkProblem}[Introduction]

This document shows a bachelor thesis proposal to be researched by the student Fernando Bombardelli da Silva (\emph{Matrikelnummer} 364924) in the \emph{Technische Universität Berlin} in the course of Computer Science (\emph{Informatik}).

The proposed research subject has theoretical bases from the areas of multi-agent system, swarm intelligence and mathematical optimization. The context of the problem to be described involves themes of growing concern nowadays, such as transportation and traffic issues, like multi-modal mobility.

\begin{homeworkSection}{Problem Description}
In current urban areas, mainly in very populated cities, there is a huge number of mobility problems. These problems have been seen with much interest by the scientific community, which has been strongly contributing to the improvement of transportation and logistic networks, thus promoting advances towards a better mobility.

The here addressed problem is known as the dial-a-ride problem (DARP). Shortly, it consists of a system with a set of requests of pick up and delivery entered by customers and a fleet of vehicles. The goal is planning the route of the vehicles and the assignment of requests to them in a feasible way, once there are constraints from both the requests and the vehicles to which a solution is subject. These can be several conditions, like location and time limit for picking up and delivering or how much time each vehicle can operate. Besides, it is not only searched a feasible solution but an optimal one that minimizes the costs of the operation defined by a function.

Many difficulties are found when trying to solve the described problem, the combinatorial nature of its solution space make it hard to treat for large inputs because of the high complexity, it leads then to a special difficulty in building a scalable application.

%- Context of the problem (Traffic problems, Alternative public transportation, goal: plan the operation and reduce its costs)\\
%- Description of the problem (Specifications, requirements, objective ...)\\
%- Difficulties in solving (high algorithmic complexity, scalability, need for REAL-TIME response ...)\\
\end{homeworkSection}

\begin{homeworkSection}{Problem Approach}

The chosen approach to solve the problem in this work is considering this as the optimization of the cost function subject to the constraints. Moreover, in order to better evaluate the results, two different methods are proposed, namely,

\begin{itemize}
	\item a mathematical program executed by a solver that delivers an exact optimal solution if there is one;
	\item an implementation of the swarming metaheuristic Firefly to obtain a near-optimal solution in polynomial time.
\end{itemize}
%Approach as an optimization problem, reducing costs of operation subject to the constraints of the customers requests.
% - 2 different ways of solving:\\
%   - Mathematical programming for exact solution with GNU LPK solver\\
%   - Implementing a swarm metaheuristic to obtain a feasible near-optimal solution (Firefly)
\end{homeworkSection}

\end{homeworkProblem}

\begin{homeworkProblem}[Justification]

It is expected that the results of this work may bring relevant contributions to the handling of the presented problem, and even of other ones. By having two distinct approaches it is possible to compare results regarding important features of the problem, such as scalability, feasibility and deviation to an optimal solution. Furthermore, the application of the relatively new firefly algorithm to the problem can show how it performs in a such a solution space.

In addition to the contributions to the understanding of the behavior of swarming metaheuristics applied to optimization problems of transportation, the new procedure of solving the problem serves as a prototype and brings a new perspective to commercial applications which seek constantly to treat the problem in a more efficient and scalable way.

With regard to the current cities' mobility, there is a growing demand for an efficient alternative to the classical means of transportation. The implementation of such a system improves the possibility of movement of the population and makes it more efficient, once it allows the decrease of the number of cars that drive through the urban network everyday causing traffic jams in big cities. Moreover, it helps to solve an demanding problem in today's society where there is an increasing number of elderly or handicapped people, who have the right to mobility and need assistance to travel in the town.


- Expected results and contribution (Evaluation of the application of swarm metaheuristic to solve the transportation problem comparing to an exact solution, feasibility, scalability, optimality ...)\\
- Importance for today's mobility in urban areas with alternative public transportation systems\\
- Economical relevance, costs minimization, concurrence advantages\\
- Ecological relevance, waste of energy and carbon fuels
