	abstract = {Dial-a-ride problems are concerned with the design of efficient vehicle routes for transporting individual persons from specific origin to specific destination locations. In real-life this operational planning problem is often complicated by several factors. Users may have special requirements (e.g. to be transported in a wheelchair) while service providers operate a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles from multiple depots in their service area. In this paper, a general dial-a-ride problem in which these three real-life aspects may simultaneously be taken into account is introduced: the Multi-Depot Heterogeneous Dial-A-Ride Problem (MD-H-DARP). Both a three- and two-index formulation are discussed. A branch-and-cut algorithm for the standard dial-a-ride problem is adapted to exactly solve small problem instances of the MD-H-DARP. To be able to solve larger problem instances, a new deterministic annealing meta-heuristic is proposed. Extensive numerical experiments are presented on different sets of benchmark instances for the homogeneous and the heterogeneous single depot dial-a-ride problem. Instances for the MD-H-DARP are introduced as well. The branch-and-cut algorithm provides considerably better results than an existing algorithm which uses a less compact formulation. All seven previously unsolved benchmark instances for the heterogeneous dial-a-ride problem could be solved to optimality within a matter of seconds. While computation times of the exact algorithm increase drastically with problem size, the proposed meta-heuristic algorithm provides near-optimal solutions within limited computation time for all instances. Several best known solutions for unsolved instances are improved and the algorithm clearly outperforms current state-of-the-art heuristics for the homogeneous and heterogeneous dial-a-ride problem, both in terms of solution quality and computation time.},

The problem consists of designing a least cost route for a vehicle of capacity Q. Each customer is allowed to be visited once for a combined pickup and delivery, or twice if these two operations are performed separately. This article proposes a mixed integer linear programming model for the SVRPPD. It introduces the concept of general solution which encompasses known solution shapes such as Hamiltonian, double-path and lasso. Classical construction and improvement heuristics, as well as a tabu search heuristic, are developed and tested over several instances. Computational results show that the best solutions generated by the heuristics are frequently non-Hamiltonian and may contain up to two customers visited twice.},

Pre-specified time windows must be respected, and service levels for passengers as well as operation costs should be optimized. The resulting routing and scheduling problem is NP -hard and can be modeled by a mixed integer linear programming formulation. In this paper, we propose a Granular Tabu Search algorithm for the static Dial-a-Ride Problem with the objective of producing good solutions in a short amount of time (up to 3 min). We evaluate the algorithm on test instances from the literature. Our new algorithm performs well in comparison with a classical Tabu Search algorithm, a Genetic Algorithm, and a Variable Neighborhood Search.},

Each customer request requires the use of a single vehicle both to load a specified amount of goods at one location and to deliver them to another location. All requests must be performed without violating either the vehicle capacity or the customer time window stipulated at each location. In this paper, we present a reactive tabu search approach to solve the pickup and delivery problem with time windows using three distinct move neighborhoods that capitalize on the dominance of the precedence and coupling constraints. A hierarchical search methodology is used to dynamically alternate between neighborhoods in order to negotiate different regions of the solution space and adjust search trajectories. In order to validate our technique's effectiveness, we have constructed a new set of benchmark problems for the pickup and delivery problem with time windows based on Solomon's benchmark vehicle routing problem with time windows data sets. Computational results substantiate the solution quality and efficiency of our reactive tabu search approach.},

This problem is characterized by the presence of heterogeneous vehicles and patients. In our problem, two types of vehicles are used, each providing a different capacity for four different modes of transportation. Patients may request to be transported either seated, on a stretcher or in a wheelchair. In addition, some may require accompanying persons. The problem is to construct a minimum-cost routing plan satisfying service-related criteria, expressed in terms of time windows, as well as driver-related constraints expressed in terms of maximum route duration limits and mandatory lunch breaks. We introduce both a three-index and a set-partitioning formulation of the problem. The linear programming relaxation of the latter is solved by a column generation algorithm. We also propose a variable neighborhood search heuristic. Finally, we integrate the heuristic and the column generation approach into a collaborative framework. The column generation algorithm and the collaborative framework provide tight lower bounds on the optimal solution values for small-to-medium-sized instances. The variable neighborhood search algorithm yields high-quality solutions for realistic test instances.},

	abstract = {Nature-inspired algorithms are among the most powerful algorithms for optimization. This paper intends to provide a detailed description of a new Firefly Algorithm (FA) for multimodal optimization applications. We will compare the proposed firefly algorithm with other metaheuristic algorithms such as particle swarm optimization (PSO). Simulations and results indicate that the proposed firefly algorithm is superior to existing metaheuristic algorithms. Finally we will discuss its applications and implications for further research.},

	title = {Efficiency {Analysis} of {Swarm} {Intelligence} and {Randomization} {Techniques}},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.6342},
	abstract = {Swarm intelligence has becoming a powerful technique in solving design and scheduling tasks. Metaheuristic algorithms are an integrated part of this paradigm, and particle swarm optimization is often viewed as an important landmark. The outstanding performance and efficiency of swarm-based algorithms inspired many new developments, though mathematical understanding of metaheuristics remains partly a mystery. In contrast to the classic deterministic algorithms, metaheuristics such as PSO always use some form of randomness, and such randomization now employs various techniques. This paper intends to review and analyze some of the convergence and efficiency associated with metaheuristics such as firefly algorithm, random walks, and L{\textbackslash}'evy flights. We will discuss how these techniques are used and their implications for further research.},
