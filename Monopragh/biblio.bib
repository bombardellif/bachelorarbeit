	volume = {67},
	issn = {0191-2615},
	abstract = {Dial-a-ride problems are concerned with the design of efficient vehicle routes for transporting individual persons from specific origin to specific destination locations. In real-life this operational planning problem is often complicated by several factors. Users may have special requirements (e.g. to be transported in a wheelchair) while service providers operate a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles from multiple depots in their service area. In this paper, a general dial-a-ride problem in which these three real-life aspects may simultaneously be taken into account is introduced: the Multi-Depot Heterogeneous Dial-A-Ride Problem ({MD}-H-{DARP}). Both a three- and two-index formulation are discussed. A branch-and-cut algorithm for the standard dial-a-ride problem is adapted to exactly solve small problem instances of the {MD}-H-{DARP}. To be able to solve larger problem instances, a new deterministic annealing meta-heuristic is proposed. Extensive numerical experiments are presented on different sets of benchmark instances for the homogeneous and the heterogeneous single depot dial-a-ride problem. Instances for the {MD}-H-{DARP} are introduced as well. The branch-and-cut algorithm provides considerably better results than an existing algorithm which uses a less compact formulation. All seven previously unsolved benchmark instances for the heterogeneous dial-a-ride problem could be solved to optimality within a matter of seconds. While computation times of the exact algorithm increase drastically with problem size, the proposed meta-heuristic algorithm provides near-optimal solutions within limited computation time for all instances. Several best known solutions for unsolved instances are improved and the algorithm clearly outperforms current state-of-the-art heuristics for the homogeneous and heterogeneous dial-a-ride problem, both in terms of solution quality and computation time.},

Classical construction and improvement heuristics, as well as a tabu search heuristic, are developed and tested over several instances.

Each customer request requires the use of a single vehicle both to load a specified amount of goods at one location and to deliver them to another location. All requests must be performed without violating either the vehicle capacity or the customer time window stipulated at each location. In this paper, we present a reactive tabu search approach to solve the pickup and delivery problem with time windows using three distinct move neighborhoods that capitalize on the dominance of the precedence and coupling constraints. A hierarchical search methodology is used to dynamically alternate between neighborhoods in order to negotiate different regions of the solution space and adjust search trajectories. In order to validate our technique's effectiveness, we have constructed a new set of benchmark problems for the pickup and delivery problem with time windows based on Solomon's benchmark vehicle routing problem with time windows data sets. Computational results substantiate the solution quality and efficiency of our reactive tabu search approach.},

This problem is characterized by the presence of heterogeneous vehicles and patients. In our problem, two types of vehicles are used, each providing a different capacity for four different modes of transportation. Patients may request to be transported either seated, on a stretcher or in a wheelchair. In addition, some may require accompanying persons. The problem is to construct a minimum-cost routing plan satisfying service-related criteria, expressed in terms of time windows, as well as driver-related constraints expressed in terms of maximum route duration limits and mandatory lunch breaks. We introduce both a three-index and a set-partitioning formulation of the problem. The linear programming relaxation of the latter is solved by a column generation algorithm. We also propose a variable neighborhood search heuristic. Finally, we integrate the heuristic and the column generation approach into a collaborative framework. The column generation algorithm and the collaborative framework provide tight lower bounds on the optimal solution values for small-to-medium-sized instances. The variable neighborhood search algorithm yields high-quality solutions for realistic test instances.},

The main difficulty of the problem is that the load of vehicles is fluctuating rather than decreasing as in the {VRP}. We design a reactive tabu search metaheuristic that can check feasibility of proposed moves quickly and reacts to repetitions to guide the search. Several new best solutions are found for benchmark problems.},

	abstract = {Nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithms, especially those based on swarm intelligence, have attracted much attention in the last ten years. Firefly algorithm appeared in about five years ago, its literature has expanded dramatically with diverse applications. In this paper, we will briefly review the fundamentals of firefly algorithm together with a selection of recent publications. Then, we discuss the optimality associated with balancing exploration and exploitation, which is essential for all metaheuristic algorithms. By comparing with intermittent search strategy, we conclude that metaheuristics such as firefly algorithm are better than the optimal intermittent search strategy. We also analyse algorithms and their implications for higher-dimensional optimization problems.},

	abstract = {Swarm intelligence has becoming a powerful technique in solving design and scheduling tasks. Metaheuristic algorithms are an integrated part of this paradigm, and particle swarm optimization is often viewed as an important landmark. The outstanding performance and efficiency of swarm-based algorithms inspired many new developments, though mathematical understanding of metaheuristics remains partly a mystery. In contrast to the classic deterministic algorithms, metaheuristics such as {PSO} always use some form of randomness, and such randomization now employs various techniques. This paper intends to review and analyze some of the convergence and efficiency associated with metaheuristics such as firefly algorithm, random walks, and L{\textbackslash}'evy flights. We will discuss how these techniques are used and their implications for further research.},

	abstract = {The paper describes a multi-objective mathematical model for Dial a Ride Problem ({DRP}) and an application of Multi-Objective Simulated Annealing ({MOSA}) to solve it. {DRP} is to take over the passenger from a place of departure to a place of arrival. In the {DRP}, customers send transportation requests to an operator. A request consists of a specified pickup location and destination location along with a desired departure or arrival time. The ultimate aim is to offer an alternative to displacement optimized individually and collectively. The {DRP} is classified as {NP}-hard problem that's why most research has been concentrated on the use of approximate methods to solve it. Indeed the {DRP} is a multi-criteria problem, the proposed solution of which aims to reduce both route duration in response to a certain quality of service provided. In this work, we offer our contribution to the study and solving the {DRP} in the application using the {MOSA} algorithm. Tests show competitive results on (Cordeau and Laporte, 2003a) benchmark datasets while improving processing times.},
